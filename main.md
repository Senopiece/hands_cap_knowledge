## The project

Data Acquisition:
1. minimal number of channels (TODO)
2. electrode placement (TODO)
3. minimal sampling rate (TODO)
4. signal filter (TODO)
5. signal to features [[Best features of EMG]]

Model (learned with supervision):
	1. Preprocess (TODO) - account for EMD, convolution, filters, add a per channel network? features dimensionality reduction [[Dimensionality reduction approaches]]
	2. Use MLP/KAN/Transformer/LSTM/etc.. (TODO)
	3. Output vector format (TODO)
	4. Ground truth hand pose: [[Precise 3D hand tracking]]
	5. Loss function (TODO)
	6. Per-user dynamic adaptation? (maybe)
