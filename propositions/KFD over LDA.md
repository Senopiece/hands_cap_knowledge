[[raurale2019emg]] proposed that KFD is better than LDA for their use case (section 4.3):

It first starts with stating that LDA is the most common choice [[LDA is the common choice for dimensionality reduction]], but follows with

> However, if less well differentiated features are input to LDA, linear discrimination leads to poorer between-class separation in the projected feature space [16]. To avoid this problem, the use of non-linear Kernel Fisher Discriminant (KFD) analysis [16] is proposed to project onto an eight-dimensional subspace from the input feature vector f.
